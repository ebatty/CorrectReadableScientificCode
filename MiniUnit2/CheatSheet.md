# Cheat sheet for readability practices

## Use good variable names
These should:
- Be nouns
- Be informative
- Be pronouncable and searchable
- Be consistent
- Be distinct
- Follow code style guide
- Exist: you should not have magic mysterious numbers not assigned to variables
- For Booleans: be affirmative and potentially contain the prefixes is or has
- Not have data type appended to variable name

## Keep it short and simple
- Keep each line of code short
- Avoid overly clever code (prioritize readability over minimizing lines of code)
- Avoid overly nested code

## Know your language and be consistent
- Follow language style guide (PEP8 for Python)
- Do same things the same way throughout your code base
- Use Python in-built functions, tools, and data types

## Use comments strategically
Good comments might:
- explain the intent of the programmer
- warn of consequences
- explain tricky code
- summarize a cohesive chunk of code
- reference relevant websites/books/etc.
