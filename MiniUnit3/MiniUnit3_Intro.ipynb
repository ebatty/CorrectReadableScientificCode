        "Functional programming is type of programming where you structure code around functions. I personally experienced a huge jump in the usability of my code when I moved from primarily using long scripts to prioritizing functions. There are a couple big advantages of using functions. One is that you are ensuring you can re-use your own code more easily! Instead of copying and pasting snippets of code if you're doing the same computation in different parts of your code, you can call the same function multiple times. This also ensures you're following a key coding principle: DRY, which means don't repeat yourself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions also can make the flow of your code clearer. Compare this long script to code that performs the same thing but that calls functions. It's much quicker to read the shorter script that calls functions. You can always go look in those functions if you want to see all the details, but often you won't need to as you can tell what it is doing from the name!\n",
        "\n",
        "Using functions also allows you to better test your code. You can test that each function is correct and does what it should, which is more manageable than testing a whole long script. We'll return to this idea in the later mini-unit on testing code."
